Angular caches the source code for each template so that subsequent references do not require another server request. However, if your application is divided into many small components, then the initial loading process may involve an unacceptably large number of additional server requests.\n\nThis plugin converts a group of templates to JavaScript and assembles them into an Angular module that primes the cache directly when the module is loaded. You can concatenate this module with your main application code so that Angular does not need to make any additional server requests to initialize the application.\n\nNote that this plugin does not compile the templates. It simply caches the template source code.\n\n## LICENSE\n\n(MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Fraserxu <xvfeng123@gmail.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
